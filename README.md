# Temporal-Relational Cross-Transformers (TRX)


This repo contains code for the method introduced in the paper:

[{DMSD-CDFSAR: Distillation from Mixed-Source Domain for Cross-Domain Few-shot Action Recognition](https:)


## Splits
We used https://github.com/ffmpbgrnn/CMN for Kinetics and SSv2, which are provided by the authors of the authors of [CMN](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Linchao_Zhu_Compound_Memory_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) (Zhu and Yang, ECCV 2018). We also used the split from [OTAM](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Cao_Few-Shot_Video_Classification_via_Temporal_Alignment_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) (Cao et al. CVPR 2020) for SSv2, and splits from [ARN](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123500511.pdf) (Zhang et al. ECCV 2020) for HMDB and UCF.  These are all the in the splits folder.
